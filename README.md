This repository contains scripts relevant data and outputs used in the following manuscript:

*Krzyzanska. M. Harriet V. Hunt, Enrico R. Crema, Martin K. Jones. 2021. 'Modelling the potential niche of domesticated buckwheat in China: archaeological evidence, environmental constraints, and climate change.'*

 
The repository is organised into four main directories: [data](data), [notebooks](notebooks), [R](R), [stan_models](stan_models) and [outputs](outputs). The data directory contains data which was compiled for the analysis and is not available online in other places. All the other other data needed for the analysis can be obtained with the script included in this repository. Notebooks directory includes Jupyter Notebooks written in R with all the scripts for data extraction, and model preparation, as well as scripts for generating figures and and other relevant output files. R directory contains R scripts with utility functions and plotting themes used in the scripts; stan_models directory contains the code for the stan model and outputs direcotry contains all of the outputs of the analysis (including intermediary outputs, provided that they don't exceed 100 MB - in which case they can be reproduced with the scripts provided).
